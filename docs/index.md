# Is Claude Hallucinating About Some Crisis in AFRINIC?

I was stumbling across the Internet today and heard that Claude hallucinates. In order to see if this was true, I asked it a very random question that popped into my mind.

# Conversation
`Innocent: Hey Claude! So what is the current situation with CloudInnovation and AFRINIC?`

**Below I provide Claude's response in full** (with its hallucinations and all. I include NONE of my own commentary! The response in in two parts)

## Part I - Pre-2023
I'd be happy to search for information about the current situation between CloudInnovation and AFRINIC. Let me look that up for you.

Searched: CloudInnovation AFRINIC dispute latest news

Based on my search, I can provide you with information about the dispute between CloudInnovation and AFRINIC:

The dispute between CloudInnovation and AFRINIC (African Network Information Centre) centers around IPv4 addresses. 
AFRINIC, which is Africa's Regional Internet Registry, attempted to revoke over 6 million IPv4 addresses from Cloud Innovation,
a company registered in Seychelles and owned by a Chinese national named Lu Heng. [Arin](https://www.arin.net/blog/2021/08/27/afrinic-and-the-stability-of-the-internet-number-registry-system/) [Afrikan Heroes](https://afrikanheroes.com/2022/08/30/afrinic-exposes-serious-breaches-of-contract-by-cloud-innovation/)

The conflict began in 2020 when AFRINIC conducted an audit and informed Cloud Innovation of alleged breaches of their Registration Service Agreement (RSA). AFRINIC claimed that Cloud Innovation was not using the allocated IP addresses for their stated purpose within the African region.

AFRINIC used an analogy to explain the situation: it was like giving a permit to build a hotel in Africa, but finding out later that a shopping center was built instead. AFRINIC claimed that Cloud Innovation failed to remedy these breaches, and in March 2021, AFRINIC initiated procedures to reclaim the resources.

The dispute escalated significantly when Cloud Innovation took legal action. In July 2021, Cloud Innovation obtained a court order that froze AFRINIC's bank accounts, which severely disrupted AFRINIC's operations.

However, there have been some legal developments in favor of Cloud Innovation. In July 2022, the Supreme Court of Mauritius ruled in favor of Cloud Innovation against AFRINIC, setting aside a preliminary objection raised by AFRINIC. [Cloudinnovation](https://cloudinnovation.org/press-release5.html)

AFRINIC claimed that its investigation revealed that "the majority of the sample of IP addresses allocated to CIL are being used for hosting websites connected to child pornography, illegal gambling, and illegal streaming of copyrighted material," though this claim was part of ongoing litigation. [Afrikan Heroes](https://afrikanheroes.com/2022/08/30/afrinic-exposes-serious-breaches-of-contract-by-cloud-innovation/)

This case has raised concerns about the stability of the Internet number registry system. The American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) expressed support for AFRINIC, stating it would "take any and all measures necessary to ensure that neither the African networking community, nor the global Internet number registry system, is operationally impacted during this period." [Arin](https://www.arin.net/blog/2021/08/27/afrinic-and-the-stability-of-the-internet-number-registry-system/)

The dispute has broader implications for internet governance, raising questions about who has the right to confiscate IP addresses and whether IP addresses are considered digital assets. [Globaltimes](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202112/1241650.shtml)

Since most of the search results are from 2021-2022, I don't have the most current information about the resolution of this dispute. Would you like me to search for more recent developments in this case?

## Part II - Recent Developments

I'll search for the most recent developments in the CloudInnovation and AFRINIC dispute.

Searched: CloudInnovation AFRINIC dispute recent developments 2023 2024

Here are the most recent developments in the CloudInnovation and AFRINIC dispute:

As of September 2023, AFRINIC (the African Network Information Centre) has been placed under receivership following a court judgment in favor of Cloud Innovation. This decision came after the Supreme Court of Mauritius ruled on the matter, with AFRINIC's legal representative being removed from court proceedings due to questions about the legitimacy of their appointment. [Circleid](https://circleid.com/posts/20230915-afrinic-faces-receivership-amidst-legal-battles)

The court ordered that elections must be held within six months from September 12, 2023, with provisions for extensions if needed. Both Cloud Innovation and another company called Crystal Web expressed approval of this ruling. [Circleid](https://circleid.com/posts/20230915-afrinic-faces-receivership-amidst-legal-battles)

The most recent update indicates that the appeal against the Receivership Order is scheduled to be heard on July 25, 2024, at the Court of Civil Appeal in Mauritius. This appeal was filed by a person named Benjamin Eshun, who secured a stay of the Official Receiver's actions in September 2023. [NRS](https://www.nrs.help/post/navigating-the-afrinic-legal-saga-unravelling-complexities-in-internet-governance)

The core issue now appears to be about governance at AFRINIC. Since September 18, 2023, AFRINIC has had no directors as their terms had fully expired. The legal documents suggest that Eshun has been attempting to appoint directors through court applications, which have been rejected. [NRS](https://www.nrs.help/post/navigating-the-afrinic-legal-saga-unravelling-complexities-in-internet-governance)

The dispute has had broader implications beyond just AFRINIC and Cloud Innovation. The controversy has influenced discussions at other Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) like APNIC (Asia Pacific Network Information Centre), where there have been calls to reform bylaws to prevent similar situations in the future. [Theregister](https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/15/apnic_election_controversy/)

The Number Resource Organization (NRO), which coordinates the five RIRs globally, has welcomed these developments, stating that successful execution of the court's orders will "restore AFRINIC to functional governance with the election of an Executive Board and appointment of a CEO" and allow AFRINIC to "resume its full participation in the NRO." [Circleid](https://circleid.com/posts/20230915-afrinic-faces-receivership-amidst-legal-battles)

This dispute has evolved from an argument about IP address usage to a more fundamental governance crisis at AFRINIC, with implications for internet governance across Africa. The upcoming court hearing in July 2024 appears to be a critical juncture for determining AFRINIC's future governance structure.
